# Leeds_Msc_Project
Aneurysm missing data imputation by deep learning using imaging and simulation data.

All the codes are run on Google Coloab, using Python 3.
Before run this pogram, we need to connect Google Colab and Google Drive.

Data:
1. All the datasets are stored on Google Driven, as the path My Drive/Msc/data/.
2. Then the sample datasets are given in the data file., containing 5 datasets in total.

Main body:
1. Upload the core folder,  data folder,  and visual folder to the Google Colab, on the root path. 
For instance, ../core, ../data, ../visual
2. Create a 'save' folder, and create a 'DBN' folder to save the traned DBN models. 
For instance, ../save/DBN
3. The main body consists of the data pre-process part and three model parts.
4. The best way to run this program is to run it from the top to the bottom.
5. The main program is msc.ipynb, should be stored in the root path to run, like ../msc.ipynb. 
Thus, this file contains not only the codes, but also some great results and figures.
